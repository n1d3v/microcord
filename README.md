# Microcord
Minicord is a lightweight Discord client made in HTML and JS.

This is a work in progress and everything may not be final! Please wait for updates.
### Why choose Microcord?
Discord in the background usually takes up 100+ MB of RAM while Microcord takes up about 30 - 50 MB which is a substantial improvement over Discords and gives extra performance when you need it.
### Please contribute!
It will help the project alot (because of my shitty ass code) and it will make the experience a whole lot better!
